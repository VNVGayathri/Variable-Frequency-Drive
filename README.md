# Variable-Frequency-Drive
The objective of this project is to control the speed of a synchronous motor using a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD). By varying the supply frequency, the motor speed is adjusted efficiently, ensuring smooth operation and improved energy savings. This project highlights the role of VFDs in achieving precise motor control in industrial applications.
